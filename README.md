# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

The password is generated using the prompt of the user through windows prompts. The selected criteria then forms an array from which a random array is generated in a for loop.
The random code is modified using a time function and more code is written to ensure the selected types are included in the final code using random array replacements.

The password is made through the generator. It is passed the to html through the writePassword function that grabs the id "password" and creates the passwordText object and uses it .value property to pass it into "password"
